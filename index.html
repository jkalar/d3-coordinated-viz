        <h3>The voter turnout rate is a mathematical expression that indicates how many eligible voters participated in an election. A variety of factors can factor into calculations of voter turnout. For the purposes of this article, voter turnout rates are expressed as follows:

Total ballots cast: This rate reflects the total number of ballots cast in a jurisdiction divided by the total number of eligible voters in that jurisdiction.
Total ballots cast for highest office: This rate reflects the total number of ballots cast for the highest office in a jurisdiction divided by the total number of eligible voters in that jurisdiction. In presidential election years, the presidency is the highest office on the ballot in every state. In non-presidential election years, the highest office on the ballot varies from state to state.
